# Kicstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project
This analysis has aims to investigate the relationship between the success of a Kickstarter campaign and their launch dates and funding goals. Visualizations created with Excel are used to support the findings.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis was conducted using the results of 4115 Kickstarter campaigns. The PivotTable and PivotChart features were used to analyze the relationship between the success of plays and their launch dates. Advanced functions, “Countifs” and “Sum”, were used to analyze the relationship between a campaign’s success and their funding goal. Visualizations were created for each analysis to assist in the communication of findings.

The data set has limitations when searching for information about the campaigns teams. There were difficulties with the analysis of time frames. This was overcome using advanced Excel functions to convert the time data into usable information. 

### Analysis of Theater Outcomes vs Launch Date
•	The summer had a large spike in the number of total campaigns and total campaigns funded successfully. This would be a good time period to launch a campaign. Failed campaigns tended to remain constant throughout the year. This suggests that a campaigns failure may not be a timing issue. 
### Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Goals
•	The outcomes based on goals suggest that goals smaller than $1,000 have a high likelihood of success. As the dollar value approaches $25,000 the success begins to decline. Once the goal exceeds the $25,000 the success or failure tends to remain constant, but the number of campaigns with these dollar values is in the single digits. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
•	This data set is limited by the information about the projects behind the campaigns. The teams performing the campaigns also matter. The dollar alone with the, type, and success are limited pieces of information to truly understand what a successful campaign looks like. 
•	Additional tables could look at the Country and success relationship, or the relationship between success and the timeline from the start of the campaign to conclusion.
